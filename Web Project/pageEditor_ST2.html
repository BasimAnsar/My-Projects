                        - A semi-transparent overlay (<code>&lt;div class="header-overlay"&gt;</code>) ensures readability.  
                        - Headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) create a strong call to action.  
                        - A call-to-action button (<code>&lt;a class="cta-button"&gt;Join Us Now&lt;/a&gt;</code>) directs users to the volunteer page.

                <h3>2. CSS Styling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexbox Layout:</strong> The website utilizes Flexbox for efficient alignment and spacing of elements like <code>.grid-container</code> and <code>.navigation-bar</code>. This ensures a dynamic and structured layout that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hover Effects:</strong> Media queries enable an adaptive design where <code>.content-section</code> restructures itself based on device width. Images and videos are optimized with <code>max-width: 100%</code> to maintain proportional scaling across all screens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Colors and Readability:</strong> A modern, accessible color scheme is used, ensuring contrast and clarity. The primary color set (#2176ae, #1a5276) is chosen to complement an educational theme. High contrast between text and backgrounds improves readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>3. Accessibility Considerations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alt Text for Images:</strong> Descriptive <code>alt</code> attributes are included for all images, such as <code>alt="Climate Changers Logo"</code>, ensuring screen readers can convey meaningful context to visually impaired users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Video Accessibility:</strong> The video element includes a fallback message ("Your browser does not support the video tag") for users with unsupported browsers. Adding captions or subtitles is recommended for better accessibility for hearing-impaired users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headings and Structure:</strong> Semantic HTML tags like <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, and <code>footer</code> improve content organization and readability for screen readers. Clear section headings make navigation easier for all users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buttons and Links:</strong> Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, are visually distinct and include hover effects. Descriptive link text (e.g., "Learn More" and "Join Us Now") improves usability for screen readers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong>  The website is fully navigable using a keyboard. Users can tab through links, buttons, and form elements. The <code>tabindex="0"</code> attribute ensures that interactive elements remain accessible for keyboard users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Form Accessibility:</strong> Forms (such as the newsletter signup) include properly associated labels with input fields, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and improving usability for all users.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Navigation Bar (nav-bar):</strong> The navigation bar (<code>nav</code>) contains links (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) to different pages of the website such as Home, Volunteer, Profile, etc. It allows users to navigate easily to various parts of the site. The navigation is visually structured with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements to separate the logo and links for better organization. The <code>alt</code> attribute for the logo image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) is set to "Climate Changers Logo" to enhance accessibility for screen readers, which is a good practice for users with visual impairments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Header Section:</strong> The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> includes a background video (<code>&lt;video&gt;</code>) that plays automatically and loops. The video is used to grab attention, highlighting the theme of the website — combating climate change.

The chart’s line and points are styled with green shades to match the environmental theme. The chart supports zooming and panning to explore data more interactively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Video Styling:</strong> The video container is styled with rounded corners and a shadow effect to ensure it blends well with the rest of the content. It is also responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hover Effects:</strong> The cards in the content section have hover effects, making them elevate and create an interactive feel. The hover effect adds an extra layer of user engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Colors and Readability:</strong> The green color palette (<code>#228b22</code>, <code>#1b691b</code>) is used throughout the website to create a visually cohesive theme related to the environment.

                <h3>3. Accessibility Considerations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alt Text for Images:</strong> All images, such as the logo and table images, include descriptive <code>alt</code> attributes like <code>alt="Climate Changers Logo"</code>, which ensures that screen readers can provide context for users who are visually impaired.</li>
                    <li><strong>Video Accessibility:</strong> The video includes a fallback message ("Your browser does not support the video tag"). It is recommended to add captions/subtitles for the video to ensure hearing-impaired users can also engage with the content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Table Accessibility:</strong> The table includes clear headers and captions that help screen readers interpret the data. It is structured with <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements for column titles and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements for data points.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buttons and Links:</strong> Buttons and links are visually distinct, with clear hover effects that help users identify interactive elements. Descriptive text is used in buttons like "Learn More" and "Join Us Now" to improve accessibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> The website is designed to be fully navigable using a keyboard. Users can tab through links, buttons, and form elements. The <code>tabindex="0"</code> attribute is used in elements to ensure they are included in the tab order.</li>
