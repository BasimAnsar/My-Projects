            <p>Educational poverty refers to the lack of access to quality education due to financial, infrastructural, and social barriers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Causes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial Constraints – Families in poverty struggle to afford school fees, uniforms, and supplies.</li>
                <li>Inadequate Infrastructure – Many schools, especially in low-income areas, lack proper classrooms, libraries, and learning materials.</li>
                <li>Shortage of Trained Teachers – Lack of qualified educators affects the quality of education and student learning outcomes.</li>
                <li>Child Labor and Early Marriages – Many children are forced to work or marry early, preventing them from completing their education.</li>
                <li>Cultural and Gender Biases – Girls and marginalized groups often face discrimination, limiting their access to schooling.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Effects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Continued Economic Hardship Cycle – Without education, individuals struggle to secure stable employment and higher wages.</li>
                <li>Limited Career Opportunities – Lack of proper education reduces job prospects and economic mobility.</li>
                <li>Social Inequality – Poor education systems widen the gap between the rich and the poor, increasing inequality.</li>
                <li>Weakened Economic Growth – Nations with low education levels struggle to develop skilled workforces, hindering economic progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Free and Accessible Education – Governments should provide free primary and secondary education for all children.</li>
                <li>Improved School Infrastructure – Investment in classrooms, libraries, and digital resources to enhance learning.</li>
                <li>Teacher Training Programs – Ensuring schools have well-trained and adequately paid educators.</li>
                <li>Scholarships and Financial Aid – Providing financial support to students from low-income backgrounds.</li>
                <li>Eliminating Social Barriers – Policies to promote gender equality and reduce discrimination in education.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Addressing educational poverty is crucial for breaking the cycle of economic hardship and fostering long-term social and economic development.
