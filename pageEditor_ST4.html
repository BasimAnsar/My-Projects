                <p>During the development of the User Profile, Site Map, and Content pages, several challenges were encountered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design Issues:</strong> Ensuring that the layout adapted well across different screen sizes required extensive testing and CSS media queries.  Specifically, aligning elements consistently across different browser versions proved difficult.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility Standards:</strong> Implementing WCAG-compliant features, such as ARIA attributes and high-contrast elements, posed challenges in balancing design and usability.  Understanding the nuances of ARIA attributes and their correct application was a steep learning curve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Navigation Structure:</strong> Creating an intuitive sitemap structure that was both visually appealing and functional required careful planning and testing.  User feedback was crucial in refining the sitemap's organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Integration:</strong> Seamlessly integrating dynamic content into the Content Page while maintaining a consistent design aesthetic required careful planning and the use of templating techniques.</li>
                </ul>
